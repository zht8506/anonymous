Figure 1: The merging weight change curve during training. The absolute scale value increases gradually and eventually stabilize. This means that the adaptive expert is constantly fitting the bias between different datasets. The merging values are negative, suggesting that the adaptive experts remove the preference scores from the shared experts, similar to a denoising process.

Figure 2: The Error vs. Reject Curves (ERC). We use ElasticFaceModel as the face recognition algorithm. The False Match Rate (FMR) is 1eâˆ’3 and dataset is LFW.
